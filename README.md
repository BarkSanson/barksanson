### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi! My name is **MartÃ­n Rizzo** and I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** at
the Balearic Islands University (_Universitat de les Illes Balears_).

My favorite languages are **C#** and **Rust**ðŸ¦€. As you can deduce, I love both high and
low level programming, although my specialization at university is the low level
branch.

I also love **Linux**, and right now I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the
OS.
